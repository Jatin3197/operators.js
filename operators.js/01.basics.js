// These operators require three operands.In JavaScript, there is one
//       operator that falls under this category â€“ the conditional operator.In
//       other languages, perhaps, there could be more examples. 
// The Conditional Operator ? ... :
// The conditional operator requires three operands:

// the conditional expression
// the truthy expression which gets evaluated if the condition is true
// the falsy expression which gets evaluated if the condition is false.
// Here's the syntax:

// condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression

const number = 70

const numberlist = 
 number > 60 ? "Even" : "Odd"

 console.log(numberlist);
// Ouput:Even
